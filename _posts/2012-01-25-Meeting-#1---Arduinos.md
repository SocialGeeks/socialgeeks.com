Start time: 2012-01-25T19:00:00  
For the first meeting of the semester we will be meeting in the CSI SUB at 7pm.  Perhaps due to change depending on the club.  We will be playing with the arduinos this night to get a little lead on what programming can do.  This will be a lead up to other nights.  

Also, since this is the first night, i want to make sure as many people are there as possible so we can get your idea's, wants of the club, and reassignments if needed all done.
