### LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SPONSOR LUNCH FOR HOARDS OF HUNGRY GEEKS ###

Join us in a hands on discussion about current trends in web attacks and exploitation.  We'll have group discussions about different subjects followed up by hands on exercises.  

Here is a list of subjects up for discussion.  I'm still fine tuning the list to what we can fit in ~5 hours.  

Overviews of the HTTP protocol
The attack surface of a web application
Reconnaissance (open source intelligence)
Attacks in action
- Injection attacks
- XSS
- CSRF
- Login weaknesseses
- Session weaknesses
- Abusing user input
- Attacking Web 2.0
- Scripting (automate what you can)
- Attacking the client

I know we won't have time to cover the above list in a five hour period with labs, but we'll spend the time covering as much as we can.  Then we can set a time to meet again.

For those of you not local, but are interested, let us know as we are trying to put together a remote option as well.
