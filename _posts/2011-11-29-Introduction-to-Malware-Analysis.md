Start time: 2011-11-29T19:00:00  
CSI -- This even will be fun for codeers and non-coders alike.  I'll be providing a VirtualBox image that we can use to analyze a piece of malware using free well-known tools.  It is only a start, but this should have something for everyone.  Don't let assembly scare you away, that only comes out at the very end. ;)
