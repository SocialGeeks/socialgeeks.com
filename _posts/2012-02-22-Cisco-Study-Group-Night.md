To all Cisco students, or people who are planning on taking the CCNA, CCENT (ICND1 & 2).  I am having a group study night Wednesday Feb 22 @ 6pm in the Cisco IT lab(Canyon 123) at CSI.  

Bring your topics you wish to discuss or better learn and we shall do what we can to teach and improve.

As a note, this is NOT a beginner study night. Advanced topics will be discussed.
