Start time: 2011-11-08T19:00:00  
Come hang out with like-minded individuals and learn about computer/network security.  Some ideas for the meeting are to continue focusing on HTTP and vulnerable web applications and how/why they are vulnerable.  Hopefully getting everybody hands on this time.  

All things security interest us, so if you have something you are interested in, bring it forward to myself or Brian Gergens.  Nothing is set in stone at this point.  If you haven't already, go watch the two videos at http://www.socialh4ck3rs.com taken from Dan Guido's pentesting class.
